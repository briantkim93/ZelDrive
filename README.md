# ZelDrive
Zeldrive is a cloud virtual drive, that appears to you like a physical drive, with whatever space you would like, and you can play around with it however you would with your Disk C , 
your external hard-drive or even like a USB drive.
What zeldrive does is that it mounts SFTP (SSH FTP). And our local filesystem, ZelFS, makes access to the data much faster, creating the illusion that all the mounted virtual drive is actually a local disk, and with a fairly reliable internet connection, it's hard to realize that the data is kept on the cloud. We make all the great and robust remote infrastructure seem local to a user, 
like an attached peripheral to a user's computer.
